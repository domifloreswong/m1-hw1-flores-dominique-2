## About Me...

*My name is Dominique Flores Wong, though everyone calls me, Domi. I am a proud Latina, making Magic at the Walt Disney Company. There, I lead content curation in the learning and development space, for Disney Vacation Club. I am also in my thrid semester at the University of Florida, getting my Master's degree in Mass Communications - Public Relations.*

## Past Coding Experience
I have plenty of experience coding, however, it was always taking the easy way out - block coding. 
For about 7 years I have volunteered as a coach and mentor for Robotics teams of children K-8, using block coding with LEGO Robotics and VEX. Drag and Drop is of course very easy to understand, hence why I teach children how to use it.

Also, at Disney we started using a new communications tool last year, Slack, which I love. I started playing with it and looking through Slack's API, to see what else I could possibly break. There I found that I could use their API as a way for "non-developers" to create formatted Slack posts. This is where I learned JSON Code. However, once again, it's API is also in blocks, and therefore very easy to understand. I have now trained hundreds of Disney Cast Members, most in different Communications roles, how to use it!

## Career Goals

In my career I am passionate about 3 things, Learning/Training, Communications (particulalry social media), and all Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion spaces. Currently I lead the Business Resource Group - Women @ Disney.  Here I am able to create content in the pillar of Talent Mobility, for all those who identify as women across the entire Disney Enterprise, that is over 75K Cast Members and Employees through The Walt Disney Company, ABC, ESPN, Lucasfilm, Marvel, Pixar, and all the many segments and subsidiaries. Because of my passion in the DE&I space, this is where I am working my way to. I want my actual 9-5 job to allow me to create content, in whatever segment within Disney, that aims to be diverse, inclusive and equitable. The exact role I currently want? Manager, DEI Project & Content Curation!

So:

1. Continue leading and growing in my stretch vounteer project of leading the BERG Women @ Disney.
2. Continue growing in becoming a champion on all things Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
3. Set myself and my team up for success to continue growing within the organization.
4. Continue networking and meeting incredible people throughout the Disney enterprise.
5. Land the dream job: Manager, DEI Project & Content Curation.
